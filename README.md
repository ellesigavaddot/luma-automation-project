To run individual tests addProductToCart and purchaseProduct execute the following commands:

1. npm run add-product-to-cart
2. npm run purchase-product


@Julia - thanks for the help, so this is what I've been stuck on:

1. My tests are heavily dependent upon logging in before doing any other interactions/actions. 
2. In running my purchaseProduct test, the browser hangs on this https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/checkout/#payment route when I try to automate a click on the "Pay Order" button. It keeps saying that the element cannot be found
